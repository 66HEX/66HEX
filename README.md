# hey, i'm hex

i build for the web — mostly **svelte 5** these days, some react, 3d experiments, and ui components.

---

### what i'm into

**svelte 5** is my main thing now. the reactivity model just clicks. still do **react** + **typescript** + **next.js** when needed. spending too much time making things spin in **three.js** and **react three fiber**/**Threelte**.

lately: **rust** + **tauri** when i need speed, **gsap** for smooth animations, raw **glsl** when i want full control.

---

### what i'm building

**motion core** — motion components for svelte 5. typography animations, 3d galleries, webgl stuff. built on gsap and three.js. distributed via cli.

**nocta ui** — shadcn like component library for react. clean and performant.

also contributing to **21st.dev** and building interactive 3d sections for **shadcnblocks.com**.

### how i think about code

if it doesn't look right, it's not done. smooth transitions, subtle interactions, the polish you notice. performance and accessibility aren't negotiable. details matter.

### tech

```js
const stack = {
  daily: ["typescript", "react", "svelte 5", "next.js"],
  visual: ["three.js", "react three fiber", "gsap", "glsl"],
  exploring: ["rust", "tauri", "webgl"],
  tools: ["vite", "git", "figma"]
};
```

### let's talk

if you're doing 3d on the web, building motion-heavy interfaces, or just want to chat about frontend — hit me up. always down to see what people are making.
