# hey, i'm hex

i make stuff for the web — mostly react apps, 3d experiments, and ui components that actually feel good to use.

got an electronics background, which probably explains why i care too much about performance and tiny visual details.

---

### what i'm working with

right now i'm deep into **react**, **typescript**, and **next.js**. also spending way too much time in **three.js** making things spin and look pretty.

lately i've been messing around with **rust** and **tauri** — it's refreshing to work closer to the metal sometimes.

for animations, i bounce between **react three fiber**, **gsap**, and occasionally raw **glsl** when i want full control.

### current projects

- building interactive 3d hero sections for shadcnblocks.com
- contributing ui components to 21st.dev (open react registry)
- working on nocta ui, my own component library
- building **lunarbase** — a rust-powered alternative to pocketbase

---

### how i think about code

code should feel good, not just work. i care about the subtle stuff — smooth transitions, thoughtful interactions, that polish that makes you stop and go "oh, nice."

performance matters. accessibility matters. details matter.

---

### tech stuff

```js
const stack = {
  daily: ["typescript", "react", "next.js"],
  visual: ["three.js", "react three fiber", "framer motion"],
  exploring: ["rust", "tauri", "glsl shaders"],
  tools: ["vite", "git", "figma", "vs code"]
};
```

### let's talk

if you're building something interesting with 3d on the web, or just want to chat about frontend stuff, hit me up. always down to see what people are making.
